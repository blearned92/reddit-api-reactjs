**Project Title:** Reddit For Lurkers

**Description:** Reddit For Lurkers is a Reddit clone with the functions of reddit without logging into/creating an account with Reddit. Browse different SubReddits, view different posts' contents, read comments from uses who have posted in the past, and do so without popups or advertisements getting in the way of your browsing. <br> This project is not intended to be used commercially or aim replace the current Reddit applications available, but was meant to push my development skills with ReactJS further than I traditionally would aim to go, to gain practice using Redux Toolkit and Fetch API (I traditionally prefer AXIOS), and to become better at problem solving by using an API I am unfamiliar with, forcing me out of my comfort zone a bit. <br> Through the execution of this project, I have learned better how to control state through Redux Toolkit, work with asyncronous Fetch API calls, and even some new hooks such as useDispatch, useLocation, and useSelector.

**Features:** 
- Browse user-created posts in a scrolling forum.
- Click to view comments section of any posts to see user interaction.
- Collapse comments chains to make navigating comments easier and more organized.
- Search currently trending subreddits with a quickbar of popular subreddits readily available.
- Search specific subreddits by searchbar.
- View community informormation for each subreddit.
- Sort subreddit posts by 'hot', 'trending', and 'new'.

**How to use:** This project is not meant for personal use of the code contained within it, and is purely a project for my own growth as a developer, so, in turn, I do not intend to collaborate with other on it at this time. However, should you want to build on this project as your own, feel free to fork this repository, clone it to a local repository, and run the command ''npm install'' to install all node packages (ensure you have Node installed on your machine first). Run ''npm start'' and begin adding or changing any features. To view this project in a browser, please visit [https://redditforlurkers.netlify.app](https://redditforlurkers.netlify.app).
